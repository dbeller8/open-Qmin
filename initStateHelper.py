""" This script allows you to supply functions of position 
    as initial conditions for the nematic director field. 
    
    Step 1. Supply three strings for the functions 
    giving the x,y,z director components, along with 
    system size and nematic degree of order.
    
    Step 2. Run the script from the command line as 
        python3 initStateHelper.py
    The script will create an initial configuration file 
    where the Q-tensor has this director field and uniform, 
    uniaxial nematic order.
    
    Step 3. You can then load the configuration file into 
    open-Qmin with the command-line flag 
        --initialConfigurationFile /path/to/my_init_file,
    or in the GUI by clicking File -> load Configuration.
